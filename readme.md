# Today WordPress Theme
A classic WordPress theme by [WPExplorer](https://www.wpexplorer.com/)

## Installation Guide
Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/wpexplorer/wpex-today/releases) click on the "Source code (zip)" link for the version you wish to install.

Once the item is downloaded the zip folder will be called "wpex-today-{version}". Unzip the theme and remove the version at the end or name the theme anything you want. Now, re-zip and upload your edited version to WordPress.

The reason for changing the folder name is because if you ever manually update it in the future the version will change so you need to ensure you are always installing/updating the theme using the same folder name.
